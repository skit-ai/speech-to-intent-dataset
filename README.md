# Skit-S2I Dataset

Dataset Release for Intent Classification task from Speech

## About

This is a dataset for Intent classification from human speech, and covers 14 coarse-grained intents from the Banking domain. This work is inspired by a similar release in the [Minds-14 dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/PolyAI/minds14) - here, we restrict ourselves to Indian English but with a much larger training set. The dataset is split into:
- test - `100` samples per intent
- train - `>650` samples per intent

The data was generated by 11 (Indian English) speakers, recording over a telephony line. We also provide access to anonymised speaker information - like gender, languages spoken, native language - so as to allow more structured discussions around robustness and bias, in the models you train.

## Download and Usage

## Uses

Most spoken dialog-systems use a pipeline of speech recognition followed by intent classification, and optimise each individually. But this allows ASR errors to leak downstream. Instead, what if we train end-to-end intent models on speech ? More importantly, how well would such models generalise in a language like Indian English - given the diversity of speech behaviours ? This dataset is an attempt towards answering such questions around robustness and model bias.

## Structure

This release contains data of (Indian English) speech samples tagged with an intent from the Banking domain. Also includes the transcript template used to generate the sample.

Audio Quality : 8 Khz, 16-bit

Structure

```
- wav_audios          [contains the wav audio files]
- train.csv           [contains the train split, where each row contains "<id> | <intent-class> | <template> | <audio-path> | <speaker-id>"]
- test.csv            [contains the test split, where each row contains "<id> | <intent-class> | <template> | <audio-path> | <speaker-id>"]
- intent_info.csv     [contains information about the intents, where each row contains "<intent-class> | <intent-name> | <description>"]
- speaker_info.csv    [contains information about the speakers, where each row contains "<speaker-id> | <native-language> | <languages-spoken> | <places-lived> | <gender>"]
